Aloha, and thanks for looking at my soda-diner project. 

To get started please install the require dependencies by typing in the root directory:

 *** 1)  npm i 

Next to seed the database please type 

 *** 2)  npm run seed 

To start the server type 

 *** 3)  npm start

That's it for configuration! Now open the browser and navigate to 

 *** 4) http://localhost:2020/

 NOTE: If this port is already being used on your system 

*** 5) in server.js edit line 9 to an open port 
                     || OR || 
                 killall -9 node


***** HOW TO USE THE ** Ubuntu Fizz Buzz Soda Diner *******

* The home page gives a description of the site and provides navigation options.
* Clicking the page logo will always return you to the home page.
* The all diners link will show all diners in the database and allows you to navigate 
the diners section. You can add new diners here, or by clicking a diner from the list you 
are provided with information and options. 
* You can add a soda to a diner here by clicking the add sodas button,
* you will be provided with a list of check-buttons that show all sodas in the db
NOT currently being served at that diner. You can select multiple options at once and add them all at once
* From the the diner details page you can also remove a diner completely and permanantly.
* By clicking a soda from the list you will be prompted to remove a soda from a particular diner.

***** THE SODAS SECTION IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE DINERS SECTIONS *****

* the soda section allows you to add and remove sodas as well as view the details of a particular soda

* When you add a new soda or a new diner the item on the main list is given a bootstrap badge for UI
* This is done using a time stamp that expires after 2 minutes

* The app provides feedback on all other aspects of navigation as well including success and error notification
and user feedback for updates.

* The app also shows further relationships between data by showing how many diners each soda is served at on the soda details page.
